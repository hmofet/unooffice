/* ===========================================================================
 * uofile - the Office 97 Open / Save As dialog.            [EXPERIMENTAL]
 * (OFFICE97-PLAN §5 phase 6d; SPEC S-OFF-05.)
 *
 * Office 97 shipped its OWN file dialogs rather than the raw common dialog -
 * a Look-in combo, the file list, a name field, a file-type combo and the
 * view buttons - and every app in the suite got the same one.  So does this.
 *
 * It is a uodlg dialog like any other; what it adds is that its list is not
 * static data.  The contents come through a FILESYSTEM SEAM: pc64 installs
 * one wrapping uno_fs_*, the host gate installs a fake, and uofile.c never
 * learns which.  That is what makes the whole thing testable without booting
 * the OS - the same trick unodoc's ud_src plays.

/* ---- the host's own file picker (optional) ---------------------------------
 * A host that HAS a native Open/Save dialog - the desktop builds - installs
 * one here, and uof_open then runs it instead of drawing the Office 97 one.
 * The hook is synchronous: it returns 1 with *vol / name / *type filled for
 * OK, 0 for Cancel, or -1 for "no picker available right now", which falls
 * back to the drawn dialog.
 *
 * The app's side does not change.  uof_open still leaves `s` holding a
 * dialog - already CLOSED, with uod_result() saying OK or Cancel - so the
 * app's ordinary "dialog closed" path runs on the next event it sees, exactly
 * as if the user had clicked the button.  pc64 never installs a hook. */
